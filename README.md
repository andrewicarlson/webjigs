# Webjigs

## What is a Jig?

A jig is a custom tool used in manufacturing. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jig_(tool))
> A jig's primary purpose is to provide repeatability, accuracy, and interchangeability in the manufacturing of products.

Software Development != manufacturing of products, but there are still plenty of practices and tools that we can repeat across projects. A webjig is then a small, single use group of code that can be reused across the web in the creation of websites or apps.

## Guide Usage

This guide is organized by the compiled asset. For example, a Sass webjig would live inside the 'CSS' directory because it will be compiled to CSS. If a webjig is composed of more than one asset type you will find it in the 'Components' directory. This README is also organized by asset type and should contain links to relevant jigs inside the repository.
