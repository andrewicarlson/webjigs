## What is a Jig?

A jig is a custom tool used in manufacturing. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jig_(tool))
> A jig's primary purpose is to provide repeatability, accuracy, and interchangeability in the manufacturing of products.

Software Development != manufacturing of products, but there are still plenty of practices and tools that we can repeat across projects.
